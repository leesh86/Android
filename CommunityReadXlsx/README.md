# Reading External xsl/xlsx File in Java #

This is a sample code in java for reading external xls/xlsx files.
This is useful for when you have a lot of data to use in your script and instead of hard-coding it in the script, 
you can read it from an external data table. 
Since JDK doesn't provide direct API to read and write Microsoft Office documents, you have to rely on third party libraries to do that. This sample uses Apache POI.
